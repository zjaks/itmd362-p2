			<h3>15. Steve Bartman- public enemy number one</h3>
			<div class="videowrap">
			<h4>October 14, 2003</h4>

			<div class="text">
			<p>In one of the most infamous moments in sports history, the Cubs were finally within earshot 
			of making it to the World Series in 2003. Five outs is all that stood between the Cubs and their
			goal. In a crazy turn of events during the top of the 8th inning, a foul ball hit down the left field 
			line suddenly was taken away from Moises Alou's glove. Alou, visibly upset, added fuel to the fire 
			of the angry fans. A man named Steve Bartman was the one who went for that ball, and the rest is 
			history. Things only unraveled from there. A number of timely hits by the Marlins and costly errors
			from the Cubs quickly unraveled a 3-0 series-clinching victory into a 8-3 stunning defeat. As things 
			continued to unravel, fans began to yell and throw things at Bartman, who quickly needed to be escorted
			from Wrigley Field. In one of Chicago sport's darkest moments, fans were out for blood for the young 
			Bartman. The next game the Cubs lost as well, losing the NLCS and bringing a World-Series bound team
			to elimination. Bartman, taking 100% of the blame, quickly became the most hated man in Chicago.</p>

			<h3>14. Patrick Kane brings Blackhawks first Stanley Cup in 49 years</h3>

			<div class="text">
			<p>The Blackhawks won their first Stanley Cup in 49 years in a very confusing fashion. The club 
			was caught in a tense overtime against the Philadelphia Flyers, and Patrick Kane fired a shot from
			a seemingly impossible angle. The puck got caught in the top corner of the net, leaving onlookers
			confused as to what had happened. Kane immediately threw his gloves off and began dancing across
			the ice. After a brief video review, officials verified that the Blackhawks were Stanley Cup 
			champions, sending relief to many lifelong fans waiting for this moment to happen again, and it was
			just a storybook beginning for the Blackhawks.</p>

			<h3>13. Sammy Sosa hits home runs 61 and 62, passes Maris</h3>
			<div class="videowrap">
			<h4>September 13, 1998</h4>

		    </div>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
			<p>The 1990's and early 2000's was considered one of the best eras of baseball. in 1998, Sammy Sosa
			and rival from the St. Louis Cardinals Mark McGwire found themselves in a home run race for the ages.
			In what seemed like a back and forth display of power night in and night out, both players were looking 
			to break the single-season home run record set by Roger Maris in 1961 with 61 home runs in a single
			season. With McGwire passing Maris' record just 5 days earlier, it was then Sosa's turn to shine.
			In the same game Sosa belted home runs number 61 AND 62, tying and passing Maris as well. This was
			the capstone of an amazing season for baseball, only to be unearthed and shunned several years later
			due to many players caught using steroids and performance enhancing substances. Sosa finished 1998
			with 66 home runs, where McGwire set the record at 70, only to fall a few years later to another 
			controversial PED user, Barry Bonds, whose record still stands at 73 home runs in a single season.</p>

			<h3>12. Walter Payton breaks the all-time rushing record</h3>
			<div class="videowrap">
			<h4>October 7, 1984</h4>
			<div class="video-container"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8agDpwxmQuQ" 
			allowfullscreen>Video of Walter Payton breaking the rushing record should be here.</iframe>
		    </div>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
			<p>Considered by many as the greatest running back, and by some the greatest football player of all
			time, Chicago Bears running back Walter Payton became the NFL’s all-time rushing leader in 1984, 
			breaking the record Cleveland’s Jim Brown set in 1965. In front of 53,752 people at Soldier Field, 
			Payton carried the ball for 154 yards and finished the game well beyond Brown's old record. 
			During the second quarter of the game, Payton made nine runs and gained 30 yards, 
			including a one-yard touchdown with three seconds left in the half. To beat Brown’s record, he 
			needed to carry the ball just three more yards. Almost as soon as the second half began, Bears 
			quarterback Jim McMahon pitched the ball to Payton in a reliable play that the team called the 
			“Toss 28 Weak.” Fullback Matt Suhey and left guard Mark Bortz protected Payton as he completed a 
			record-setting six-yard run. He didn’t take much time to celebrate, though. All week, Bears 
			officials had been urging their star to let them stop the game for a ceremony when he finally 
			broke the rushing record, but Payton maintained that the team’s momentum was more important than 
			his achievement. So, the festivities were brief. Payton accepted his teammates’ congratulatory 
			hugs and handshakes, turned the record-setting football over to a representative from the Pro 
			Football Hall of Fame, and went back to the game. (He did take a call from President Ronald Reagan
			afterwards.) His dedication paid off: The Bears won the game 20-7 and Payton set one more record, 
			for carrying the ball more than 100 yards for the 59th time in his career.</p>

			<h3>11. "The Shot"</h3>
			<div class="videowrap">
			<h4>May 7, 1989</h4>

		    </div>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
			<p>In 1989, Michael Jordan had yet to win an NBA title and was still trying to prove himself as 
			one of the league's best players. In the Bulls' 1989 first round playoff series against the 
			Cleveland Cavaliers, he quieted some of his critics. The Bulls were down by one point with three 
			seconds remaining in the game. Jordan took the inbound pass and hit a buzzer-beating shot to bring 
			the team into the second round to the playoffs. The Bulls did not win a title that season, but 
			"The Shot" became remembered as one of Jordan's most clutch moments in his career. It was replayed 
			on television hundreds of times, to the agony of Cleveland fans and the ecstasy of Bulls supporters. 
			It was only one basket, yet it played an integral role in the fortunes of not one but two NBA franchises.</p>

			<h3>10. Kerry Wood strikes out 20</h3>
			<div class="videowrap">
			<h4>May 6, 1998</h4>

		    allowfullscreen>Video of Kerry Wood's 20 strikeouts should be here.</iframe>
		    </div>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
			<p>Few pitchers had the phenom hype like Kerry Wood had in 1998. In only his fifth major league 
			start, he did something that still has yet to be beaten until this day. Facing the Houston Astros, 
			who at the time were one of the best hitting teams in the league, Wood had a dominating day. The 
			Astros managed one infield single and Wood hit a batter, so it wasn't a perfect game or even a 
			no-hitter, if it was, it might have been the greatest game ever pitched. This sparked the career of
			Kerry Wood and a short time where the Cubs had real hope at a title run. You can see and hear the 
			electricity in the air that day in the video above. This was an exciting time in Cubs history, and 
			one that will always be remembered. Wood never did quite live up to the full hype however, as arm
			injuries really affected his career from then onward.</p>

			<h3>9. Bears dominate the Redskins 73-0</h3>
			<div class="videowrap">
			<h4>December 8, 1940</h4>
			<div class="video-container"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PZcp4DX1aJE"

			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
			<p>In the ultimate case of a revenge game, the Bears had their second meeting with the Washington 
			Redskins in 1940. The first meeting was just a few weeks earlier, as the Bears lost 7-3. The 
			Redskins coach, George Preston Marshall, told reporters that Halas and his team were “quitters” 
			and “cry babies.” Halas used Marshall’s words to galvanize his players, and the Bears scored 78 
			points in their next two games to set up a showdown with the Redskins in the league’s championship 
			game on December 8, also in Washington. The bears came out of the gate firing, and never looked back.
			At the end of the bloodbath, the Bears were on top 73-0, and were world champions. This started a 
			1940's Bears dynasty where they won championships four times in seven years. When Washington Redskins
			quarterback Sammy Baugh was asked if a dropped touchdown pass earlier in the game would have affected 
			the outcome or change momentum, he stated: "Sure. The final score would have been 73–7."</p>

			<h3>8. Devin Hester- super run caps a ridiculous season</h3>
			<div class="videowrap">
			<h4>February 4, 2007</h4>
			<div class="video-container"><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ED1Qdp8EG6A" 
			allowfullscreen>Video of Devin Hester should be here.</iframe>
			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
			<p>Devin Hester is now regarded by most as the best return man of all time in the NFL. 2006 was his 
			rookie breakout season, in which he scored five times on a punt or kickoff return, and then another
			from a missed field goal. He was a large reason the 2006 Bears were a team to be feared. Even when 
			he didn't score, he always put the Bears in great field position to score from just a short amount 
			of yardage away. He became so feared, that teams would specifically plan each week not to kick the 
			ball to him, instead opting for short kicks or kicking out of bounds, which still led into the Bears'
			favor. When the Bears rode their defense and special teams to Super Bowl XLI, all eyes were on Hester
			as the opening kickoff took place. Amazingly, the Colts kicked the ball to Hester, and he made them
			pay, resulting in the first opening kickoff return in Super Bowl history. Bears players and fans alike
			were going nuts on the sideline and at home. The celebration was short-lived, however, as the Bears
			ended up losing to the Colts by a score of 29-17.</p>

			<h3>7. Michael Jordan's "Flu Game"</h3>
			<div class="videowrap">
			<h4>June 11, 1997</h4>

			allowfullscreen>Video of Michael Jordan's Flu Game should be here.</iframe>
			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
			<p>Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals was pivotal. The Bulls were tied 2-2 with the Utah Jazz in the 
			series and needed a win to avoid facing elimination. Bulls superstar Michael Jordan was needed to
			help the team overcome the Jazz who posed a threat to the Bulls' finals streak. The big story 
			coming into the matchup was a stomach virus or food poisoning that Michael Jordan had contracted 
			the day before. At 2 a.m on Tuesday morning, Jordan called his personal trainer to his hotel room, 
			where he was lying in the fetal position and sweating profusely. The Bulls' trainers told Jordan that 
			there was no way he could play the next day. The Jazz had just won Games 3 and 4 to tie the series 
			at 2 wins a piece, and a third consecutive win would give them the lead. The Bulls needed their 
			leader for this critical game, and despite his sickness, Jordan got out of bed at 5:50 p.m on 
			Wednesday, just in time for the 7 o'clock tip-off at the Delta Center. It's unclear how bad Jordan's 
			sickness actually was, but it clearly showed as Jordan often looked like he was on the verge of 
			collapse. Jordan didn't just play in the game, but he dominated in a way only Michael Jordan could, 
			scoring 38 points and adding to his already prominent legacy. The Bulls won the game 90-88, and in
			the final seconds Jordan collapsed into the arms of another Bulls star, Scottie Pippen, leaving a
			lasting image of what would forever be called "The Flu Game". The Bulls won the following game, 
			which clinched their second-consecutive championship and fifth overall.</p>

			<h3>6. Blackhawks win on home ice- become a dynasty</h3>
			<div class="videowrap">

			</div>
			<div class="text">
			<p>After a crushing defeat in the Conference Finals of 2014 by the LA Kings, the Blackhawks again
			made it in to the Stanley Cup finals in 2015. The Blackhawks, considered again one of the best teams 
			in the NHL that year, finally had a chance to win their third Stanley cup in six years, a complete
			overhaul from their 49 year drought before. The titles in 2010 and 2013 were both clinched outside 
			of Chicago, but the Hawks had the opportunity to snag the cup in Chicago for the first time since 
			1938. With the Hawks playing a tough Tampa Bay Lightning team, fans new victory was all but certain. 
			The Lightning, as the club with the better regular-season record, held home-ice advantage in the 
			series. With the Lightning taking a 2-1 series lead, it gave the Blackhawks something to be on 
			their heels. The Hawks won game four at the United Center and game five in Tampa before returning 
			home again to the United Center to finish the series out. In a tough game, the Blackhawks held the
			Lightning in check en route to a 2-0 victory. As the final buzzer sounded, pandemonium broke out
			inside of the United Center, giving fans something they had been waiting a generation for.</p>

			<h3>5. Michael Jordan's final shot wins sixth championship for Bulls</h3>
			<div class="videowrap">

			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
			<p>Michael Jordan's Bulls swan song was one to be remembered. The Bulls again found themselves in 
			the NBA finals, looking for their sixth title and second three-peat. The Bulls again faced the 
			formidable Utah Jazz. It was long rumored that Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Phil Jackson 
			would not be returning to the Bulls the following year. In what seemed like that last time the 
			unit would be together, the Bulls went back and forth with the Jazz most of the series, as the Jazz
			had the same record coming in but a higher seed, giving them home field advantage. During game six,
			the Bulls' Scottie Pippen aggravated a back injury early in the game, which made the Bulls dependent
			on Jordan one last time. With time winding down, The Bulls and Jazz went back and forth in a close 
			game. With victory almost in the hands of Utah, Jordan stole the ball away and dribbled down the 
			court. With 10 seconds remaining, Jordan started to dribble right, then crossed over to his left. 
			Jordan hit the 20-foot jumper to give the Bulls an 87–86 lead with 5.2 seconds left. In what would
			be his last shot in a Bulls uniform, Jordan was again immortalized as the clock wound down, giving
			the Bulls their sixth championship, leaving no doubt that they were one of the most dominating teams 
			in NBA history. Jordan was named NBA finals MVP once again (he was also MVP the previous five times).

			<h3>4. Mark Buehrle's Perfect Game</h3>
			<div class="videowrap">
			<h4>July 23, 2009</h4>
			<div class="video-container"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DCfilbWZM8s" 
			allowfullscreen>Video of Mark Buehrle's Perfect Game should be here.</iframe>
			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
			<p>Mark Buehrle was considered a fan favorite pitcher for the White Sox for his entire tenure with 
			the team. He was never considered an elite pitcher in the game, but he was considered one of the 
			most consistent. Already having a no-hitter under his belt in 2007, and a World Series champion in 
			2005 with the White Sox, Buehrle was no stranger to the spotlight. Shortly into the July 23rd game 
			against the Tampa Bay Rays, it became clear that Buehrle was going to have a special day. 
			At the time, the Rays were tied for their second-highest on-base percentage (.343) of any team, so
			they were one of the least likely to allow a perfect game. Buehrle had plenty of run support that 
			day, as Josh Fields contributed early with a grand slam. Buehrle's big day did not come without 
			some drama though, as in the top of the ninth inning, the Rays' leadoff hitter Gabe Kapler hit a 
			deep fly ball to left-center field, where DeWayne Wise made a spectacular catch, taking a home run
			away from Kapler and saving the perfect game for Buehrle. Wise was a defensive replacement prior 
			to the ninth inning. The next batter struck out swinging. The final batter, Jason Bartlett, hit a 
			ground ball to shortstop Alexei Ramirez, who threw it to first to finish off the history-making 
			moment for Buerle. Hawk Harrelson, the long time White Sox play-by-play announcer, said that "under
			the circumstances one of the greatest catches I have ever seen in 50 years in this game". As 
			Buehrle neared the perfect game, he told the audience: "Call your sons! Call your daughters! 
			Call your friends! Call your neighbors! Mark Buehrle has a perfect game going into the ninth!".
			Buehrle became only the 18th player in history to record a perfect game at the time of his 
			performance. There now have been 23 perfect games in history.</p>

			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
			<p>The Blackhawks opened their 2012-2013 campaign with the best start to a season in NHL history. 
			The team had a magical run through the playoffs, which included a historic comeback against the 
			Detroit Red Wings. The Hawks were down by one goal against the Boston Bruins in the final two 
			minutes of Game six in the Stanley Cup Finals. A loss would send the series to a win-or-go-home game
			seven. With 90 seconds left in the game, the team pulled goalie Corey Crawford for an extra skater, 
			and Hawks captain Jonathan Toews assisted Bryan Bickell on a goal to tie the game. Just 17 seconds 
			later, Dave Bolland scored on a rebound to clinch the Hawks' second Stanley Cup championship in 
			four years. It is one of the most dramatic turnarounds in one game in Blackhawks history, and one
			that cemented the Blackhawks as a force to be reckoned with for years to come, especially in the
			playoffs. It was the first time a team had won the Stanley Cup in regulation time by overcoming a 
			deficit in the final two minutes.</p>
