		<div>There are many things that Chicagoans care about: Tall buildings, food, city life, summer, 
		and even politics. </div>
		<div>And yet, nothing compares to our love of history.</div> 
		<div>Millions of people visit The Windy City every year, and many go to our beautiful museums.</div>
		<div>What some do not realize, however...</div>
		<div>is that we have amazing museums elsewhere that can house 
		tens of thousands of people at one time.</div>
		<div>Chicago's stadiums house some of the most iconic franchises in sports history.</div>
		<div>And some of the greatest moments in sports that the world has ever seen...</div>
		<div>Many fans around the world go to sporting events for entertainment,</div>
		<div>but our fans go for the love of the game.</div>
		<div>No matter what the season... or the weather condition.</div>
		<div>No matter how long we have been waiting for our team to finally do the unthinkable.</div>
		<div>We thrive off the past,</div>
		<div>with iconic names of our legends.</div>
		<div>From Jordan...</div>
		<div>to Sweetness...</div>
		<div>Banks, Sandberg...</div>
		<div>Thomas, Aparicio, Shoeless Joe...</div>
		<div>Butkus, Sayers, Singletary, Halas, Ditka...</div>
		<div>Hull, Mikita, Esposito...</div>
		<div>Pippen, Jackson...</div>
		<div>Although we look to the past, we are hopeful for the future of sports in our city.</div>
		<div>The stars of today look to give ourselves and our families even more memories to cherish.</div>
		<div>And above all else...</div>
		<div>The one thing we look to achieve...</div>
		<div>Is GLORY.</div>
		<div>This is Chicago.</div>
		<div>We are Skyline Sports.</div>
